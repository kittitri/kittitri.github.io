        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>Sport has been in my blood for as long as I can remember. I was born to be in the mountains, to play in the mud, and to churn through tough terrain. <br>
        It all stems from having a very powerful internal drive for challenge and adversity – to find the hardest thing I could, and try to crack it. I suppose this was how I calibrated my sense of accomplishment and proved to myself that I could do anything. Coming from a small town in Scotland, all I knew was I could work harder than anyone else and push myself further than others seemed willing to go. That mentality, I believed, would always get me places.  And so my path led me to pursue triathlon: a sport that at the time was seen to be hardcore, difficult, crazy and unusual. Perfect.</p>
